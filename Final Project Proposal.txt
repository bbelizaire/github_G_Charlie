Final Project Proposal

Concept: Inspired by apps like Journal (Apple), Headspace, and Dailyo, this project is centered around mental health tracking. The goal is to create a simple and intuitive tool where users can reflect on emotional well- being daily. I want to focus on the overload of passive consumption and being able to use technology for digital wellbeing. 

Format: Web based in p5.js
Tools: p5.js, GitHub, HTML/CSS

Presentation: Live demo during class time to show mood entry prices, visuals generated from mood logs.

Documentation:
Git comment messages
Documenting on a doc 
Comments within my code

Steps & Timeline
