Final Project Proposal

Concept: Inspired by apps like Journal (Apple), Headspace, and Dailyo, this project is centered around mental health tracking. The goal is to create a simple and intuitive tool where users can reflect on emotional well- being daily. I want to focus on the overload of passive consumption and being able to use technology for digital wellbeing.
